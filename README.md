This repo contains my advent of code attemps. 

I first started doing them in 2023, and as I really enjoyied it I thought I would create a folder with space for feature years. 

Each day's challenge in contained in one file, with all the inputs in a dir in that year. Hopefully the code will run both challenges and print the answer to the console. 

While undertaking AoC, I used it as practise for writing good code that is easily maintainable, however this did not extend to well commented code. Please forgive me for this oversight -- useally by the time I was done, I didn't want to see the code ever again.
